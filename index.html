            <h1>Welcome to Fine Tweedy Guitars!</h1>
            <p>
                Tweedy flat-top guitars, ukuleles, mandolins, and other stringed
                instruments are handmade to the highest quality, sound quality, and
                with the finest, cleanest construction. All instruments are
                constructed from exquisite, solid wood using 100% hide glue.
            </p>
            <p>
                My mission over the past 15 years has been to achieve the best
                possible sound from my instruments. Based on the reaction that I
                have received from several fine shops, I now believe that I have
                achieved that goal. Right now I have 2 guitars hanging at
                <a href="http://www.sbguitarbar.com/">Santa Barbara Guitar Bar</a>,
                a truly amazing guitar shop in the heart of Santa Barbara's new
                "Funk Zone" -- a unique art and business district down by Stearn's
                Wharf. I could not have imagined a better place to have my guitars
                out for sale.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just finished a commission for an 8-string tenor uke and may have
                a line on building at least one more. So, it appears that the recent
                ukulele craze continues on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three instruments are still available. They are the product of a
                long build that had many interruptions, mostly tools and jigs that
                needed making. I'm excited about these new guitars, they all sport
                the new <a href="#">diamond volute</a> and represent my work
                proudly. <a href="#">Check them out!</a>
